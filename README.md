## Data Sources

#### Coronavirus Data

TO DO: Generate rates for TOTAL confirmed and deaths

County-level time series data on US coronavirus infections and deaths from January 21 through August 4, 2020 were acquired from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. View their Github repository for more in-depth documentation at https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19. 

**Important Note:** Due to the nature of our analysis, data is up to date through August 4th.

In addition, we used the the U.S. Census Bureau 2019 Population Estimates [dataset](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html) to convert coronavirus stats into rates so that counties different population sizes could be compared.

#### Demographic and Economic Data

County-level demographic and economic data (median household income, minority population, etc) were acquired from the 2018 American Community Survey ([ACS](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs)) 5-Year Profile data.
